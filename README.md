# 🌱 Spring Boot CRUD Operations

This project is a **Spring Boot application** demonstrating basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations using Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, and a relational database. It serves as a practical implementation of RESTful services with proper API design and layered architecture.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Create new records (POST)
- 📄 Retrieve all or specific records (GET)
- 🔄 Update existing records (PUT)
- 🗑️ Delete records (DELETE)
- 🧪 Simple, testable REST APIs
- 🎯 Follows MVC pattern and layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Language**: Java
- **Database**: H2 / MySQL / PostgreSQL (as configured)
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle
- **JPA**: Spring Data JPA for database interaction
- **Testing**: Postman / Swagger UI for API testing

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Springboot-CURD-Operations.git
cd Springboot-CURD-Operations
```

### 2. Open in IDE

Import the project into **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or your preferred Java IDE as a Maven or Gradle project.

### 3. Configure Database (Optional)

- For H2 (in-memory): No config needed.
- For MySQL/PostgreSQL: Update `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name
spring.datasource.username=your_user
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### 4. Build and Run the Application

```bash
# If using Maven
mvn spring-boot:run

# If using Gradle
./gradlew bootRun
```

### 5. Test the APIs

- Visit: `http://localhost:8080/api/your-endpoint`
- Use **Postman**, **curl**, or Swagger (if integrated) to test API routes.
